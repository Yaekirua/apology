        <p>"My Dearest Love,

            I want to start by apologizing for not responding to your heartfelt message sooner. It was never my intention to keep you waiting, but circumstances beyond my control led to this delay. Please know that the reason for my delayed response was not due to a lack of desire to communicate with you, but rather a series of unexpected events that took up my time.
            
            You are not just my friend; you are my confidant, my partner in all things, and the love of my life. I want nothing more than for you to remain my girlfriend, for you are my significant other, my partner in crime, my confidant in all things, my better half, and the source of my pride. This is not a casual fling to me; it's a love that runs deep, and I cherish every moment we share together.
            
            I know we've discussed the distractions we can sometimes be to each other, and while there may have been moments when we got carried away, it doesn't negate the incredible impact you've had on my life. The challenges I faced in subjects like statistics and physics were not your fault, and I take full responsibility for those circumstances. You have been my motivation to excel academically, and thanks to you, I have learned how to study effectively. Your support has been invaluable, and I believe that together, we can overcome any obstacles that come our way.
            
            I implore you not to leave me now, for you mean the world to me. I look forward to celebrating every anniversary with you, and I promise that we will be refined enough to provide our future children with the best possible upbringing. I am committed to personal growth and will work tirelessly to ensure that you never doubt my dedication.
            
            Yes, I think about you every day because you are the love of my life, and I am deeply invested in our future together. I assure you that things will be different, and I will not let anger or frustration come between us. I have picked up new hobbies and activities to keep myself occupied and focused, and I look forward to our conversations and interactions in the future.
            
            I firmly believe that a breakup is not always the solution to our problems. Two heads are better than one, and I want us to tackle any challenges that come our way as a team. Our relationship is precious to me, and I want us to stand by each other, no matter the circumstances.
            
            I love you more than words can express, and I sincerely hope that we can work through this together. If you have made it this far, please screenshot this message and send your response over text. I respect your decision, whatever it may be.
            
            With all my love,
        Hizal"</p>
